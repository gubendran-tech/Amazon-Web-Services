You had issues with the root account being locked since it was assigned to an old employee.\n\nThe steps to resolve this would be:\n\n1) Click the forgot my password for the root account and we would send a link to reset it to the email registered: itsupport@kitchenbrains.com \n\nHowever, in your case this root account also has MFA enabled so even if you reset the password and use the new one, the next screen will prompt for the MFA token code which I assume you do not have.\n\nSo the best solution for you would be step two:\n\nWhat If an MFA Device Is Lost or Stops Working? Please refer to:\n\n[+] http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_lost-or-broken.html\n\nOnce you get this done you can change the root credentials anytime using the steps in link below (there are edit options for name and email address too):\n\n[+] http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_change-root.html\n\nHope this was helpful.

Access denied for the user using password no possible not the error related to the permissions. Have you tried to reset the master user password to connect to the instance again? I do not see any action taken from Amazon to resolve the issue, it should have been some change from your end.\n\nTo reset the master user password your RDS account, login into your RDS account. Select the instance that you want to modify and click the drop-down menu bar that says 'Instance Actions' and in that drop-down list click 'Modify'. On the next page you would set the password under the Settings 'New Master Password' and select the 'Apply Immediately' check-box and click Continue.\n[+]http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ModifyInstance.MySQL.html\n\nAs RDS is a managed service, you would not be able to Grant all privileges on all the databases and that is the reason why you received the 'Error Code: 1045 Access denied for user 'msdataadmin'@'%' (using password: YES)'. The documentation below lists all the privileges that are assigned to default master user in Maria DB Instance. \n[+]http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.MasterAccounts.html\n\nThe default master user 'msdataadmin' for 'msmetadata' DB instance should have the privileges you mentioned in the correspondence that are required for the user. If you are unable to create to trigger/any other issues with the database, to troubleshoot the issue further please provide the following information:\n\nConnect to the DB instance and run the following commands:\nmysql> select user, host from mysql.user;\nmysql> show grants for msdataadmin\\G\n\nAlso, you would be able to create a user that has same privileges as your current master user: \n\nmysql> CREATE USER 'mynewuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; \n\nmysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, RELOAD, PROCESS, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER, SHOW DATABASES, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE USER, EVENT, TRIGGER ON *.* TO 'mynewuser'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;\n\nmysql> flush privileges;\n\nI will look forward for you response.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMeenakshi T.\nAmazon Web Services\nWe value your feedback.

I understand that you want to add an A record into the domain \"mysck.net\" for your ELB \"mswselbexternal-1898365471.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com\".\n\nIn compliance with security best practices, AWS engineers do not have the ability to update your records or work with your resources. However, I will be more than happy to guide you on updating the record in Route53.\n\nFirst, taking a look at your Route53 resources, I do not see any Hosted Zones under this account. If you have another account that uses this domain, please do create a ticket on that account for the best possible assistance. If you want to create the record on this account, then please do the following steps below.\n\n1) Go to the Route53 Hosted Zone at: https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53\n\n2) Select \"Get Started Now\" under DNS Management, and choose \"Create Hosted Zone\"\n\n3) In the Create Hosted Zone pane, enter \"mysck.net\" and click \"Create\"\n\n4) Choose the hosted zone you just created on the \"Hosted Zones\" page and click \"Create Record Set\".\n\n5) In the right panel, select \"Yes\" for Alias and in the box that next to Alias Target, look for the ELB \"mswselbexternal-1898365471.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com\" and hit \"Save Record Set\". Please note, you can change the routing policy or set up health evaluation as you need.\n\nThis public doc goes over creating record sets in details:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html\n\nPerforming the command \"whois msck.net\", I also see that the domain belongs to the third-party registrar \"NETWORK SOLUTIONS, LLC.\".\n\nYou will want to make sure that the name servers are propagating to the name servers in Route53, which are of type \"NS\". This has to be done at the domain provider's website.\n\nThis is the third-party documentation for Network Solutions:\nhttp://www.networksolutions.com/support/move-dns-to-a-new-server/\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBen\nAmazon Web Services\nWe value your feedback.

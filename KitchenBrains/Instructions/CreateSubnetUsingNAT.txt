To create a NAT gateway
---------------------------

Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

In the navigation pane, choose NAT Gateways, Create NAT Gateway.

In the dialog box, specify the subnet in which to create the NAT gateway, and select an Elastic IP address to associate with the NAT gateway. When you're done, choose Create a NAT Gateway.

The NAT gateway displays in the console. After a few moments, its status changes to Available, after which it's ready for you to use.

Note : Make sure you attach public subnet and elastic ip.

What is public Subnet ?

Subnet which you created will have RouteTable association with internet gateway.

Route Tables for a NAT Device
-------------------------------
To enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the Internet, you can create a NAT gateway or launch a NAT instance in a public subnet, and then add a route for the private subnet that routes Internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT device. For more information, see NAT Gateways and NAT Instances.

To create a custom route table
-------------------------------
Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

In the navigation pane, choose Route Tables.

Choose Create Route Table.

In the Create Route Table dialog box, you can optionally name your route table for Name tag. Doing so creates a tag with a key of Name and a value that you specify. Select your VPC for VPC, and then choose Yes, Create.

Adding and Removing Routes from a Route Table (Attach the NAT / IG in the route association)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can add, delete, and modify routes in your route tables. You can only modify routes that you've added.

To modify or add a route to a route table

Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

In the navigation pane, choose Route Tables, and then select the route table.

In the Routes tab, choose Edit.

To modify an existing route, replace the destination CIDR block or a single IP address for Destination, and then select a target for Target. Choose Add another route, Save.

To associate a route table with a subnet (Private Subnet)
----------------------------------------------------------

Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

In the navigation pane, choose Route Tables, and then select the route table.

On the Subnet Associations tab, choose Edit.

Select the Associate check box for the subnet to associate with the route table, and then choose Save.

How to create private subnet (Means subnet with NAT gateway) ?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Once you create NAT Gateway, create subnet and attach route table association with nat gateway which you created. 


Good Explaination from AWS Support to resolve the issue
---------------------------------------------------------

1) created NAT Gateway in Public Subnet
2) Updated the route table to use the NAT Gateway
3) Created a Private Subnet
4) Associated the subnet with ROute table
5) launched an instance in the private subnet
6) From the Jumpbox, you were able to connect to Private instance
7) You were able to access internet from this instance using NAT Gateway.
